      <h2>How I Built This Project</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🗂️ Hosted on a private <strong>S3 bucket</strong> (static hosting disabled)</li>
        <li>🔒 Secured with <strong>CloudFront + Origin Access Control (OAC)</strong></li>
        <li>🌐 Served over HTTPS using <strong>ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)</strong></li>
        <li>🌍 Custom domain registered in <strong>Amazon Route 53</strong></li>
        <li>🤖 CI/CD pipeline built with <strong>GitHub Actions</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every time I push code to GitHub, the site is automatically deployed to AWS using a secure, serverless pipeline.</p>
