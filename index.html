    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm passionate about Linux systems, cloud automation, and infrastructure as code. I'm currently pursuing RHCSA and building hands-on projects like this one to sharpen my DevOps skills.</p>
      <p>I currently work as a NOC Engineer at Saudi Investment Bank, where I focus on Application and Network Performance Monitoring (APM/NPM). I help ensure the stability and responsiveness of critical systems by analyzing application behavior, optimizing network flow, and using deep monitoring tools to troubleshoot end-to-end performance issues.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™m also AWS SAA certified and actively building my DevOps portfolio with CI/CD pipelines, serverless architectures, and automated cloud deployments using GitHub Actions and AWS tools.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hosted on a private <strong>S3 bucket</strong> (static hosting disabled)</li>
        <li>Secured with <strong>CloudFront + Origin Access Control (OAC)</strong></li>
        <li>Served over HTTPS using <strong>ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)</strong></li>
        <li>Custom domain registered in <strong>Amazon Route 53</strong></li>
        <li>CI/CD pipeline built with <strong>GitHub Actions</strong></li>
