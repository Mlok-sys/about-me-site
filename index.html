    <h2>How I Built This Project</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🗂️ Files are hosted in a <strong>private S3 bucket</strong> (static hosting disabled)</li>
      <li>🔒 Access is secured using <strong>Origin Access Control (OAC)</strong> with CloudFront — a modern and more secure alternative to the legacy OAI method</li>
      <li>🌐 Served through <strong>CloudFront</strong> with HTTPS and custom domain</li>
      <li>🔑 SSL certificate provisioned via <strong>AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</strong></li>
      <li>🌍 Domain registered and managed using <strong>Amazon Route 53</strong></li>
      <li>🤖 Fully automated with <strong>GitHub Actions CI/CD</strong> — pushing to GitHub updates the site live via AWS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project is part of my cloud portfolio and reflects my ability to build secure, automated AWS environments using industry best practices.</p>
